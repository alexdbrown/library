To Ashlin and Rick,

Firstly, happy Thursday! Boy, are you in for a treat! At quittin' time yesterdee, we were working on our Checkout class, and ran into an error with our save, getAll and deleteAll methods. It seems the ids we were setting in our tests were saving as strings and not BIGINT(20) UNSIGNED's :( . If you have any questions, please direct them to php-help.epicodus.com per normative best practices. Finally, please include our names first in the final README.

Best of luck,

Alex and Deron
